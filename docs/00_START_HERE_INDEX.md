6. **Use Verification Scripts** - They catch errors before you waste time

7. **Ask for Help** - If stuck, provide specific error messages and context

8. **Take Breaks** - Code quality drops when tired

9. **Track Progress** - Update PROGRESS.md daily

10. **Celebrate Wins** - Each completed phase is an achievement
